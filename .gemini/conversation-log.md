### Session Summary: 2025-08-09

**Topic:** Initial Progress Review and C Fundamentals

**User Progress:**
- Reviewed four C files: `pun.c`, `exercises-1.c`, `fah-to-cel.c`, and `d-weight.c`.
- The code indicates progress through the early chapters (likely 1-4) of "C Programming: A Modern Approach".
- Key concepts practiced include:
    - Basic program structure (`main`, `printf`)
    - Variables (`int`, `float`) and user input (`scanf`)
    - Arithmetic expressions
    - Use of functions
    - Creation of constants using both `#define` and `const`.

**Key Concepts Discussed:**
- **`#define` vs. `const`**:
    - User correctly identified `#define` as a preprocessor macro (text substitution) and `const` as a true, type-safe variable.
    - Discussed the low-level implications:
        - **Type Safety**: `const` variables are type-checked by the compiler.
        - **Scope**: `const` variables obey standard C scoping rules, whereas `#define` macros do not.
        - **Debugging**: `const` variables are visible to the debugger, while macros are not.
    - Concluded that `const` is the more modern and generally safer approach.

### Session Summary: 2025-08-09 (Part 2)

**Topic:** Chapter 5 - Selection Statements (`if`)

**User Progress:**
- Successfully created a new program, `number_checker.c`, to determine if an integer is positive, negative, or zero.
- Demonstrated a strong understanding of the `if-else if-else` structure for multi-way branching.
- Applied excellent coding practices by:
    - Separating logic into a dedicated function (`give_output`).
    - Using `const` to ensure function parameters are not accidentally modified.

**Key Concepts Discussed:**
- The syntax and logic of `if`, `else if`, and `else`.
- How to combine these statements to handle multiple conditions.

**Next Steps:**
- The `switch` statement was introduced as the next topic from Chapter 5.
- The user has decided to pause here and will revisit the `switch` statement in the next session.

### Session Summary: 2025-08-13

**Topic:** Chapter 5 - The `switch` Statement

**User Progress:**
- Successfully created a new program, `grade.c`, to evaluate a character grade.
- Mastered character input/output using `scanf` with the `%c` format specifier.
- Demonstrated a full understanding of the `switch` statement's structure, including `case` labels, `break`, and the `default` case.
- Cleverly used "case fall-through" to handle both uppercase and lowercase letter grades efficiently.
- Continued to apply excellent coding practices by decomposing the program into well-defined functions (`get_char`, `print_grade`) with prototypes and using `const` where appropriate.

**Key Concepts Discussed:**
- The `switch` statement as an alternative to `if-else if` chains for discrete values.
- Character literals (`'A'`) vs. strings (`"A"`).
- The concept of "fall-through" in `switch` statements.
- Reinforcement of function decomposition and `const` correctness.

**Next Steps:**
- Ready to begin the next section of Chapter 5: **loops**, starting with the `while` statement.
